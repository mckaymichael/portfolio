                    <p>My name is Michael McKay. It took me a while to find what I love, but ultimately that passion became coding and art. I love to learn, and it's usually what I spend my time doing outside of school. If it's not learning how to draw, code, linguistics, or design, I'm either climbing, coaching basketball, doing photography, or walking my dogs.</p>
