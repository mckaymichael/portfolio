                <p>Thanks to the help of my group, this project was possible. Learned just how valuable it is to spread the work amongst other people. I also learned that the job is enjoyable when you spend time with people who are all focused on a common goal in mind. The photos on display above are some of the wireframes that I created as one of the UI designers.</p>
